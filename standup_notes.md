## Project0 Reflection

Philip Wentworth - 
1. Everything went fairly well 
2. I could've asked for help to get JUnit working earlier, I spent more time than necessary troubleshooting it
3. If I'm stuck on something for longer than an hour I'll ask if anyone else has encountered and already solved the problem I'm dealing with

Hannah Hospital - 
1. What went right? 
I was able to (mostly)successfully create all of my menus and I had most of the required functionality for students and faculty. I was also able to successfully persist the data into tables of my database.

2.What could I improve upon?
I could have implemented tests for both FacultyService and StudentService. I had difficulty successfully writing test methods. I could also have better planned my blueprint for starting p0. I didnâ€™t spend enough time truly planning out the flow of the application, and it was reflected in my implementation.

3.Going forward what steps are you going to take?
I would put more emphasis on the planning phase of SDLC. I think I might utilize Kansan boards next time. 
I also spend far too much time creating useless functionality in my services and DAOS. To improve the quality of this project, I will be getting rid of the unused functions in my DAOS and services, and I will also implement a method in the FacultyService, such that faculty members can directly view the available courses in the Registration Catalog. I would want my application to be more user friendly.


Austin Ristau -  
1 Everything that I put in functioned.
2 Work on more sound logic testing and flushing the project out
3 Create a sound plan, make a list and chip away at it.


Michael Bronzo - 
1) Got most of the functionality I needed
2) Leave myself more time so I could have had more time to finishing testing and add in other features
3) Start earlier and ask questions earlier


Josh Evans - 
1. All of the pieces came together really easily. I'm a little shocked I didn't have more trouble conecting my app to the sql database.
2. I think I would have ended up with a better functioning project if I had planned things better from the beginning.
3. Start planning early in the code wirting process.

## p1 Discussions

Phil + Darrell: 
A feature is a service function, and a service function is considered complete when its test function runs without error.

Michael + Austin: 
A feature needs to be fully functionally and at least have most of the JDBC logic.

Hannah Hospital + Josh Evans:
Our definition of done is whenever a feature is completely functional, and the DAOs are able to return a booelan to the service layer, allowing us to know that the CRUD operations were successfully completed. 
Also, feature is a service function and it must run under test without any error.
